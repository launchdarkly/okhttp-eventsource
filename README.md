## Overview

This library allows Java developers to consume Server Sent Events from a remote API, using [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) as the transport layer. The SSE spec is defined here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html

Starting in version 2.0, this library uses OkHttp 4.x and requires Java 8+. If you need support for OkHttp 3.x or Java 7, use the latest 1.x version.
