/**
 * The SSE client.
 * <p>
 * By default, EventSource makes HTTP requests using OkHttp, but it can be configured
 * to read from any input stream. See {@link ConnectStrategy} and {@link HttpConnectStrategy}.
 * <p>
 * Instances are always configured and constructed with {@link Builder}. The client is
 * created in an inactive state.
 * <p>
 * The client uses a pull model where the caller starts the EventSource and then requests
 * data from it synchronously on a single thread. The initial connection attempt is made
 * when you call {@link #start()}, or when you first attempt to read an event.
 * 
 * To read events from the stream, you can either request them one at a time by calling
 * {@link #readMessage()} or {@link #readAnyEvent()}, or consume them in a loop by calling
 * {@link #messages()} or {@link #anyEvents()}. The "message" methods assume you are only
 * interested in {@link MessageEvent} data, whereas the "anyEvent" methods also provide
 * other kinds of stream information. These are blocking methods with no timeout; if you
 * need a timeout mechanism, consider reading from the stream on a worker thread and
 * using a queue such as {@link BlockingQueue} to consume the messages elsewhere. 
 * <p>
 * Note that although {@code EventSource} is named after the JavaScript API that is described
 * in the SSE specification, its behavior is not necessarily identical to standard web browser
 * implementations of EventSource: by default, it will automatically retry (with a backoff
 * delay) for some error conditions where a browser will not retry, and it also supports
 * request configuration options (such as request headers and method) that the browser
 * EventSource does not support. However, its interpretation of the stream data is fully
 * conformant with the SSE specification, unless you use the opt-in mode
 * {@link Builder#streamEventData(boolean)} which allows for greater efficiency in some use
 * cases but has some behavioral constraints.

     * first and {@code event:} second, {@link MessageEvent#getEventName()} will <i>not</i> contain the value of
     * {@code event:} but will be {@link MessageEvent#DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME} instead; similarly, an {@code id:} field will
     * be ignored if it appears after {@code data:} in this mode. Therefore, you should only use this mode if the
     * server's behavior is predictable in this regard.</li>  
     * <li> The SSE protocol specifies that an event should be processed only if it is terminated by a blank line, but
     * in this mode the handler will receive the event as soon as a {@code data:} field appears-- so, if the stream
     * happens to cut off abnormally without a trailing blank line, technically you will be receiving an incomplete
