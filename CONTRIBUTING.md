## Build instructions
 
### Prerequisites
 
The project builds with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and should be built against Java 8.
 
### Building

To build the project without running any tests:
```
./gradlew jar
```

If you wish to clean your working directory between builds, you can clean it by running:
```
./gradlew clean
```

If you wish to use your generated SDK artifact by another Maven/Gradle project such as [java-server-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-server-sdk), you will likely want to publish the artifact to your local Maven repository so that your other project can access it.
```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

### Testing
 
To build the project and run all unit tests:
```
./gradlew test
```

## Note on Java version and Android support

This version of the library is used by the LaunchDarkly server-side Java SDK, which has a minimum Java version of 8. The LaunchDarkly Android SDK does not fully support Java 8, and currently uses the older 1.x branch of `okhttp-eventsource`.

## Code coverage

It is important to keep unit test coverage as close to 100% as possible in this project.

You can view the latest code coverage report in CircleCI, as `coverage/html/index.html` in the artifacts for the "Java 11 - Linux - OpenJDK" job. You can also run the report locally with `./gradlew jacocoTestCoverage` and view `./build/reports/jacoco/test`.

Sometimes a gap in coverage is unavoidable, usually because the compiler requires us to provide a code path for some condition that in practice can't happen and can't be tested, or because of a known issue with the code coverage tool. Please handle all such cases as follows:

* Mark the code with an explanatory comment beginning with "COVERAGE:".
* Run the code coverage task with `./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification`. It should fail and indicate how many lines of missed coverage exist in the method you modified.
* Add an item in the `knownMissedLinesForMethods` map in `build.gradle` that specifies that number of missed lines for that method signature.
